      <p class="conten-body">The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) is an international standard for describing
        language ability. It describes language ability on a six-point scale, from A1 for beginners, up to C2 for those
        who have mastered a language. This makes it easy for anyone involved in language teaching and testing, such as
        teachers or learners, to see the level of different qualifications. It also means that employers and
        educational institutions can easily compare our qualifications to other exams in their country.</p>
